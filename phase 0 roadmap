# Hundo Leago — Phase 0 Finish Roadmap

**Phase Name:** Phase 0 — Stability & Rule Lock‑In
**Purpose:** Finish and harden the current live‑season system so it can run reliably with real managers, real money‑like constraints, and minimal commissioner intervention.

Phase 0 is **not** about new fantasy features. It is about making sure the current league can finish a season without surprises, exploits, or emergency fixes.

---

## Phase 0 Core Truths (Non‑Negotiable)

* The site is **live** and in active use.
* Backend persisted state is the **source of truth**.
* Temporary illegal rosters **are allowed**:

  * From **Sunday 4:00 PM → Monday 4:00 PM PT**
  * After auction resolution or trades
* Rosters must be legal by **Monday at 4:00 PM PT**.
* The system must never block actions just because a roster is temporarily illegal.

---

## Phase 0 Goals (What “Done” Means)

By the end of Phase 0:

* Auctions are fair, understandable, and abuse‑resistant
* Trades and buyouts cannot silently create broken state
* Temporary illegality is allowed but clearly surfaced
* Commissioner tools are safe and auditable
* The league can finish a season with confidence

---

## Session Breakdown (Bite‑Sized, Beginner‑Friendly)

Each session targets **~3–6 hours** and should be done in a fresh chat.

---

## Session 0A — Production Safety Lock‑In

**Goal:** Eliminate any chance of accidentally wiping live data.

### Tasks

* Verify frontend never seeds default rosters into backend
* Confirm backend always prefers persisted state over defaults
* Add explicit comments / guardrails around any reset logic

### Done When

* You are confident no normal deploy can reset the league

---

## Session 0B — Illegal Roster Window Rules

**Goal:** Encode the *grace period* rules explicitly.

### Tasks

* Document (in code comments + rules UI):

  * Illegal rosters are allowed from Sunday 4 → Monday 4
* Ensure **no system logic** blocks:

  * Auction wins
  * Trade acceptance
  * Buyouts
    solely due to illegality during the window
* Ensure legality checks are **warnings**, not blockers

### Done When

* Illegal roster warnings are clear but non‑blocking

---

## Session 0C — Auction Edge‑Case Hardening

**Goal:** Make auction outcomes predictable and explainable.

### Tasks

* Confirm behavior when winning bid creates illegal roster:

  * Allow win
  * Log the illegality
* Improve logging clarity:

  * Price paid vs max bid
  * Why a price was chosen (anti‑bluff rule)
* Improve UI clarity (optional but recommended):

  * Show edits remaining
  * Show cooldown timer

### Done When

* Managers understand *why* they paid what they paid

---

## Session 0D — Pending Trade Interaction Rules

**Goal:** Prevent dangling or invalid trades.

### Rules

* Players **may** be involved in actions while in pending trades
* If a player in a pending trade is **bought out**:

  * That trade must be **automatically cancelled**

### Tasks

* On buyout:

  * Detect pending trades involving that player
  * Cancel them automatically
  * Log the cancellation with reason: `playerBoughtOut`

### Done When

* No pending trade references a non‑existent player

---

## Session 0E — Activity Log Completeness

**Goal:** Make the league history trustworthy.

### Tasks

* Ensure all destructive actions log clearly:

  * Buyouts
  * Trade cancellations (manual + automatic)
  * Commissioner removals
* Ensure logs are ordered, timestamped, and readable

### Done When

* The log can explain *any* roster change

---

## Session 0F — Commissioner Tool Safety Pass

**Goal:** Prevent accidental damage by the commissioner.

### Tasks

* Add confirmations to irreversible actions
* Ensure commissioner actions cannot leave half‑applied state
* Ensure commissioner actions always log

### Done When

* Commissioner mistakes are recoverable and visible

---

## Session 0G — End‑of‑Season Readiness

**Goal:** Make it safe to *finish* the season.

### Tasks

* Confirm nothing auto‑resets on date changes
* Confirm snapshots/backups exist (manual OK for Phase 0)
* Document end‑of‑season procedure (manual steps)

### Done When

* You know exactly how the season ends without panic

---

## Definition of “Phase 0 Complete”

Phase 0 is complete when:

* You trust the system during high‑stress moments
* Managers cannot exploit auctions or trades
* Temporary illegal states are allowed and visible
* No single bug can force a league reset

---

## What Phase 0 Explicitly Does NOT Include

* Player stats or scoring
* Matchups or standings
* Draft system
* Auth or multi‑league support

Those belong to Phase 1+.

---

**Phase 0 mantra:** If it affects a live league today, it must be boring, explicit, and safe.
